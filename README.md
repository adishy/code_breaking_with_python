## Code-breaking with Python

### Introduction
* This is a small (and hopefully fun) Python project for beginners, that introduces them to various Python language concepts such as functions, loops, and simple data structures such as lists. The student is challenged to put together simple building blocks into a more complex and elaborate algorithm, with the final goal being to decipher messages encrypted using a substitution cipher.
* It also provides a gentle introduction to cryptography concepts and terminology and the project spec is written around a hopefully-not-too-corny spy theme. 
* The project code and instructions are bundled together in a Jupyter notebook and a Python package containing tests that can help guide the participant towards their eventual goal of deciphering the messages.

### Usage:
* Ensure the accompanying `imf_cryptographers` package is installed locally using `pip`. This package contains tests and a reference implementation that the notebook uses to verify correctness.
* You can deploy the `python_code_breaking` Jupyter notebook in any compatible environment once the accompanying package is installed.
