    "The I.M.F (Impossible Mission Force) has been tracking the suspicious activity of some extremely shady people for some time now, and we believe that this group is planning something big and dangerous. What's worse is that we have evidence that they may act upon these nasty ideas soon. I.M.F agents have intercepted the group's communication systems and have figured out that they have been exchanging a lot of messages that are encrypted using an unconventional technique called the [\"Ceaser cipher\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). As the I.M.F's top cryptographer, your mission, _should you choose to accept it_, is to write some Python code that breaks their encryption so that I.M.F agents can successfully penetrate their operation and **save lives**."

    "### Part 1: Critical, top secret information about the encryption scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ceaser ciphers have their origins in ancient Rome, when messages were physically written on parchment and carried by messengers on horseback. These were often the last line of defense if the messenger was captured, as the text in the message would be meaningless to the reader. The good news, for us, is that this encryption scheme is pretty simple to understand, and will probably be no trouble at all for the I.M.F's top cryptography expert, you!\n",
    "\n",
    "* To encrypt messages using this scheme, we take the following steps:\n",
    "    * Each letter in the original message (called \"plaintext\" in cryptography terminology) is numbered according to its position in the alphabet of the language the message is written in. In English, this would be `1 - 26` (or `0 - 25`, if you are a programmer), where `1` represents the first letter of the alphabet ('A') and `26` represents the last letter of the alphabet ('Z').\n",
    "    * Then, we pick a random integer `k` and add this integer to each of the indices of the letters in our message. The new indices we obtain indicate the index of the each of the letters to substitute in our original, that constitutes our encrypted message (called \"ciphertext\"). This integer is also referred to as the \"shift\", since it shifts one letter to another by its value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * An example one of our agents decrypted in the field:\n",
    "\n",
    "    | Message | Indices | Shift | Encrypted |\n",
    "    | ------- | ------- | ----- | --------- |\n",
    "    | H       | 8       | +2    | J         |\n",
    "    | E       | 5       | +2    | G         |\n",
    "    | L       | 11      | +2    | N         |\n",
    "    | L       | 11      | +2    | N         |\n",
    "    | O       | 14      | +2    | Q         |\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here, the group had selected a shift of `2` to encrypt their message, shifting each of the letters of the original message as shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A problem you may notice here, is that the random integer, `k` may be greater than the number of letters in the alphabet. In this case, you would \"wrap around\" the alphabet once you encounter the last letter and continue counting from the first letter.   \n",
    "    * Say the shift (`k`) that was chosen was `27`. In this case, the shifts would be performed as follows:\n",
    "     \n",
    "    | Message | Indices | Shift | Encrypted |\n",
    "    | ------- | ------- | ----- | --------- |\n",
    "    | H       | 8       | +27   | I         |\n",
    "    | E       | 5       | +27   | F         |\n",
    "    | L       | 11      | +27   | M         |\n",
    "    | L       | 11      | +27   | M         |\n",
    "    | O       | 14      | +27   | P         |\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When adding `27` to `H`, we encounter `Z` `18` letters in front - at this point, we wrap around back to `A` and count the remaining `9` letters forward, getting `I` as our result. This process is repeated for all the letters as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The following information was obtained by several of I.M.F's best field agents and some of them even gave their lives to get this information out. Treat this with the utmost importance!**\n",
    "   * Your code will have to account for the \"wrap around\" behavior to correctly decode many of the messages. Our field agents inform us that they heard the words _\"Python modulo operator\"_ many times when investigating within the circles that members of the group hang out with. Perhaps this is a clue to decrypting their messages more easily!\n",
    "\n",
    "   * One of our top field agents, Ethan Hunt, managed to infiltrate the group and extract some critical information from one of their top members. Here's what he managed to find out:\n",
    "       * All the messages the group has exchanged have been in English. All the words used in the messages are also `in` the dictionary. This information may enable you to devise a way to figure out when you've successfully decrypted the message.\n",
    "       * They do not use any punctuation marks or non-alphabetical symbols except the space character (\" \").\n",
    "       * The ciphertext contains both upper and lower case letters as a red-herring. The group actually writes all their messages entirely in lowercase - we expect your code to decode the messages correctly, despite this trickery!\n",
    "       \n",
    "   * Our agent's cover was unfortunately blown before he was able to intercept the shifts corresponding to the ciphertext messages, but he managed to inform us that each of the messages has a different shift. The code you write will have to deduce the shifts corresponding to each message automatically.\n"
